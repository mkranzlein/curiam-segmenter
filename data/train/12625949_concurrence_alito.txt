Justice ALITO , with whom Justice BREYER and Justice KAGAN join , concurring .
We took this case to decide whether willful infringement is a prerequisite to an award of profits under 15 U.S.C. ยง 1117 ( a ) .
The decision below held that willfulness is such a prerequisite .
App . to Pet . for Cert . 32a .
That is incorrect .
The relevant authorities , particularly pre - Lanham Act case law , show that willfulness is a highly important consideration in awarding profits under ยง 1117(a ) , but not an absolute precondition .
I would so hold and concur on that ground .
