Justice SOTOMAYOR , concurring .
Like my colleagues in both the majority and the partial dissent , I agree that 15 U.S.C. ยง 1692k(d ) is a one - year statute of limitations that typically begins to run when the alleged violation " occurs , " not when the plaintiff discovers it .
Compare ante , at 358 , with post , at 362 ( GINSBURG , J. , dissenting in part and from judgment ) .
The only daylight between the majority and dissenting opinions is whether petitioner Rotkiske forfeited reliance on an " equitable , fraud - specific discovery rule " that forgives otherwise untimely filings .
Ante , at 359 - 362 ; cf . post , at 364 - 365 .
Because I believe the Court of Appeals fairly found that Rotkiske failed to preserve an equitable argument of this sort , see 890 F.3d 422 , 429 , and n. 5 ( C.A.3 2018 ) , and because the Court did not grant certiorari on that doctrine , I join the majority opinion .
I write separately to emphasize that this fraud - specific equitable principle is not the " ' bad wine of recent vintage ' " of which my colleagues speak .
Ante , at 360 ( quoting TRW Inc. v. Andrews , 534 U.S. 19 , 37 , 122 S.Ct . 441 , 151 L.Ed.2d 339 ( 2001 ) ( Scalia , J. , concurring in judgment ) ) .
Rather , the Court has long " recogni[zed ] " and applied this " historical exception for suits based on fraud . "
I d . , at 37 , 122 S.Ct . 441 ; see also i d . , at 27 , 122 S.Ct . 441 ( majority opinion ) ( noting equitable discovery rule " in cases of fraud or concealment " ) ; Holmberg v. Armbrecht , 327 U.S. 392 , 66 S.Ct . 582 , 90 L.Ed . 743 ( 1946 ) ; Exploration Co. v. United States , 247 U.S. 435 , 38 S.Ct . 571 , 62 L.Ed . 1200 ( 1918 ) ; Bailey v. Glover , 21 Wall . 342 , 22 L.Ed . 636 ( 1875 ) ; Sherwood v. Sutton , 21 F.Cas . 1303 ( No . 12,782 ) ( C.C.D.N.H. 1828 ) ( Story , J. ) .
Nothing in today 's decision prevents parties from invoking that well - settled doctrine .
