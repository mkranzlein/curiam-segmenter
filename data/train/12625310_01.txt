Justice SOTOMAYOR , with whom Justice GINSBURG joins , concurring .
I join the majority opinion because I agree that 29 U.S.C. ยง 633a imposes liability even when age is not a " ' but - for cause ' " of a personnel action .  
Ante , at 1171 .
I write separately to make two observations .
First , the Court does not foreclose ยง 633a claims arising from discriminatory processes .
Cf .  Comcast Corp. v.   National Assn . of African American - Owned Media , 140 S.Ct . 1009 ( GINSBURG , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) .
If , for example , an employer hires a 50 - year - old person who passed a computer - aptitude test administered only to applicants above 40 , clearly a question could arise as to whether the hiring decision was " made free from " differential treatment .
Second , this same example may suggest that ยง 633a permits damages remedies , even when the Government engages in nondispositive " age discrimination in the ' ma[king ] ' of a personnel decision . "
Ante , at 1176 .
If an applicant incurs costs to prepare for the discriminatorily administered aptitude test , a damages award compensating for such out - of - pocket expenses could restore the applicant to the " position tha[t ] he or she would have enjoyed absent discrimination . "
Ante , at 1178 .
