Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court .
The Armed Career Criminal Act ( ACCA ) , 18 U.S.C. § 924 ( e ) , mandates a 15 - year minimum sentence of imprisonment for certain defendants with prior convictions for a " serious drug offense . "
A state offense ranks as a " serious drug offense " only if it " involv[es ] manufacturing , distributing , or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute , a controlled substance . "
§ 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) .
This case concerns the methodology courts use to apply that definition .
While the parties agree that a court should look to the state offense 's elements , they disagree over what the court should measure those elements against .
In the Government 's view , the court should ask whether those elements involve the conduct identified in § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) -namely , " manufacturing , distributing , or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute , a controlled substance . "
Petitioner Eddie Lee Shular , however , contends that the terms employed in the statute identify not conduct , but offenses .
In his view , those terms are shorthand for the elements of the offenses as commonly understood .
According to Shular , the court must first identify the elements of the " generic " offense , then ask whether the elements of the state offense match those of the generic crime .
Under the approach he advances , Shular argues , his sentence is not subject to ACCA enhancement .
The generic offenses named in § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) , as Shular understands them , include a mens rea element of knowledge that the substance is illicit .
He emphasizes that his prior convictions were for state offenses that do not make knowledge of the substance 's illegality an element of the offense ; the state offenses , he therefore maintains , do not match the generic offenses in § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) .
The question presented : Does § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) 's " serious drug offense " definition call for a comparison to a generic offense ?
We hold it does not .
The " serious drug offense " definition requires only that the state offense involve the conduct specified in the federal statute ; it does not require that the state offense match certain generic offenses .
I
Ordinarily , a defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm , in violation of § 922(g)(1 ) , faces a maximum sentence of ten years .
§ 924(a)(2 ) .
If the offender 's prior criminal record includes at least three convictions for " serious drug offense[s ] " or " violent felon[ies ] , " however , ACCA mandates a minimum sentence of 15 years .
§ 924(e)(1 ) .
To determine whether an offender 's prior convictions qualify for ACCA enhancement , we have used a " categorical approach , " under which we look " only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses . "
Taylor v. United States , 495 U.S. 575 , 600 , 110 S.Ct . 2143 , 109 L.Ed.2d 607 ( 1990 ) .
Under this approach , we consider neither " the particular facts underlying the prior convictions " nor " the label a State assigns to [ the ] crime[s ] . "
Mathis v. United States , 579 U.S. ---- , ---- , 136 S.Ct . 2243 , 2251 , 195 L.Ed.2d 604 ( 2016 ) ( internal quotation marks and alterations omitted ) .
So , for example , to apply ACCA 's provision defining " violent felony " to include " burglary , " § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii ) , we ask only whether the elements of the prior conviction constitute burglary ; we do not ask what the person did or whether the offense of conviction was named " burglary . "
Under some statutes , using a categorical approach requires the court to come up with a " generic " version of a crime - that is , the elements of " the offense as commonly understood , "
i d. , at ---- , 136 S.Ct . , at 2247 .
We have required that step when the statute refers generally to an offense without specifying its elements .
In that situation , the court must define the offense so that it can compare elements , not labels .
For example , in Taylor , confronted with ACCA 's unadorned reference to " burglary , " we identified the elements of " generic burglary " based on the " sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States . "
495 U.S. at 598 - 599 , 110 S.Ct . 2143 ; § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii ) .
We then inquired whether the elements of the offense of conviction matched those of the generic crime .
Id. , at 602 , 110 S.Ct . 2143 .
See also , e.g. , Esquivel - Quintana v. Sessions , 581 U.S. ---- , ---- , 137 S.Ct . 1562 , 1568 , 198 L.Ed.2d 22 ( 2017 ) ( " generic federal definition of sexual abuse of a minor " for purposes of 8 U.S.C. § 1101 ( a)(43)(A ) ) .
In contrast , other statutes calling for a categorical approach ask the court to determine not whether the prior conviction was for a certain offense , but whether the conviction meets some other criterion .
For example , in Kawashima v. Holder , 565 U.S. 478 , 132 S.Ct . 1166 , 182 L.Ed.2d 1 ( 2012 ) , we applied a categorical approach to a statute assigning immigration consequences to prior convictions for " an offense that ... involves fraud or deceit " with a loss exceeding $ 10,000 .
§ 1101(a)(43)(M)(i ) .
The quoted language , we held , " mean[s ] offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful conduct . "
Id. , at 484 , 132 S.Ct . 1166 ( emphasis added ) .
Consequently , no identification of generic offense elements was necessary ; we simply asked whether the prior convictions before us met that measure .
Id. , at 483 - 485 , 132 S.Ct . 1166 .
See also , e.g. , Stokeling v. United States , 586 U.S. ---- , ---- - ---- , 139 S.Ct . 544 , 554 , 202 L.Ed.2d 512 ( 2019 ) ( determining whether an offense " has as an element the use , attempted use , or threatened use of physical force against the person of another , " 18 U.S.C. § 924 ( e)(2)(B)(i ) ) .
This case invites us to decide which of the two categorical methodologies just described applies in determining whether a state offense is a " serious drug offense " under ACCA . ACCA defines that term to include :
" an offense under State law , involving manufacturing , distributing , or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute , a controlled substance ( as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act ( 21 U.S.C. [ § ] 802 ) ) , for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law . "
18 U.S.C. § 924 ( e)(2)(A)(ii ) .

Shular pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida to possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony , in violation of § 922(g)(1 ) , and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base , in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841 ( a)(1 ) and ( b)(1)(C ) .
The District Court sentenced Shular to imprisonment for 15 years , the mandatory minimum under ACCA , to be followed by three years of supervised release .
In imposing that enhanced sentence , the District Court took account of Shular 's prior convictions under Florida law .
In 2012 , Shular pleaded guilty to five counts of selling cocaine and one count of possessing cocaine with intent to sell , all in violation of Fla. Stat . § 893.13 ( 1)(a ) .
That law makes it a crime to " sell , manufacture , or deliver , or possess with intent to sell , manufacture , or deliver , a controlled substance . "
Ibid .
For those offenses , " knowledge of the illicit nature of a controlled substance is not an element , " but lack of such knowledge " is an affirmative defense . "
§ 893.101(2 ) .
Shular 's six convictions under that Florida law , the District Court concluded , qualified as " serious drug offense[s ] " triggering ACCA enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 924 ( e)(2)(A)(ii ) .
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the sentence .
736 Fed . Appx . 876 ( 2018 ) .
It relied on Circuit precedent holding that a court applying § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) " need not search for the elements of ' generic ' definitions " of any offense , because the statute " require[s ] only that the predicate offense ' involv[e ] ' ... certain activities . "
United States v. Smith , 775 F.3d 1262 , 1267 ( 2014 ) .
Courts of Appeals have divided on whether § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) 's " serious drug offense " definition requires a comparison to a generic offense .
Compare , e.g. , i d. , at 1267 ( no generic - offense comparison ) , with United States v. Franklin , 904 F.3d 793 , 800 ( C.A.9 2018 ) ( court must define a generic crime ) .
We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict , 588 U.S. ---- , 139 S.Ct . 2690 , 204 L.Ed.2d 1088 ( 2019 ) , and now affirm the Eleventh Circuit 's judgment .

A
The parties here agree that § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) requires a categorical approach .
A court must look only to the state offense 's elements , not the facts of the case or labels pinned to the state conviction .
They differ , however , on what comparison § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) requires .
Shular would require " a generic - offense matching exercise " : A court should define the elements of the generic offenses identified in § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) , then compare those elements to the elements of the state offense .
Brief for Petitioner 13 - 14 .
In the Government 's view , a court should apply " the Kawashima categorical approach " : It should ask whether the state offense 's elements " necessarily entail one of the types of conduct " identified in § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) .
Brief for United States 13 , 20 ( emphasis added ) .
This methodological dispute is occasioned by an interpretive disagreement over § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) 's reference to " manufacturing , distributing , or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute , a controlled substance . "
Those terms , in the Government 's view , describe conduct a court can compare directly against the state crime 's elements .
Shular sees them instead as offenses whose elements a court must first expound .
B
The Government 's reading , we are convinced , correctly interprets the statutory text and context .
Two features of § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) , compared against a neighboring provision referring to offenses , § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii ) , show that § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) refers to conduct .
First , the terms in § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) -"manufacturing , distributing , or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute , a controlled substance"-are unlikely names for generic offenses .
Those words undoubtedly can be used to describe conduct .
But as Shular acknowledges , they are not universal names of offenses ; instead , States define " core drug offenses with all manner of terminology , including : trafficking , selling , giving , dispensing , distributing , delivering , promoting , and producing . "
Reply Brief 7 .
Contrast § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) with § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii ) , the enumerated - offense clause of ACCA 's " violent felony " definition , appearing in the same section of the Career Criminals Amendment Act of 1986 , 100 Stat . 3207 -39 to 3207 - 40 .
That provision , which refers to a crime that " is burglary , arson , or extortion , " requires a generic - offense analysis .
See Mathis , 579 U.S. , at ---- , 136 S.Ct . , at 2248 .
The terms " burglary , " " arson , " and " extortion"-given their common - law history and widespread usage - unambiguously name offenses .
Cf . , e.g. , Taylor , 495 U.S. at 590 - 599 , 110 S.Ct . 2143 ( discussing " burglary " ) .
Drug offenses , Shular admits , lack " the same heritage and the same established lexicon . "
Brief for Petitioner 14 .
Second , by speaking of activities a state - law drug offense " involv[es ] , " § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) suggests that the descriptive terms immediately following the word " involving " identify conduct .
The parties agree that " involve " means " necessarily requir[e ] . "
Brief for Petitioner 14 ( citing Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1005 ( 2d ed . 1987 ) ( " to include as a necessary circumstance , condition , or consequence " ) ) ; Brief for United States 21 ( same ) .
It is natural to say that an offense " involves " or " requires " certain conduct .
E.g. , § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii ) ( addressing a crime " involv[ing ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another " ) ; Mathis , 579 U.S. , at ---- , 136 S.Ct . , at 2250 ( " The generic offense [ of burglary ] requires unlawful entry into a building or other structure . " ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) .
To refer to offenses as Shular urges , it would have been far more natural for the drafter to follow the enumerated - offense clause in using " is , " not " involving . "
See § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii ) ( crime that " is burglary , arson , or extortion " ) .
There , the word " is " indicates a congruence between " crime " and the terms that follow , terms that are also crimes .
See American Heritage Dictionary 114 ( def . 7a ) ( 1981 ) ( " To equal in meaning or identity " ) .
Yet Congress did not adopt that formulation in § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) , opting instead for language suited to conduct .
C
Shular principally urges that at the time of § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) 's enactment , federal and state criminal laws widely prohibited the " core conduct " of manufacturing , distributing , and possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute drugs .
Brief for Petitioner 10 - 12 .
Some laws , Shular observes , used those very terms .
See , e.g. , 21 U.S.C. § 841 ( a)(1 ) ( 1982 ed . ) .
But even if the substance of state drug laws was well established - rather than their nomenclature , which Shular concedes was not - Congress could capture that substance by reference to conduct , rather than offenses .
Shular points out that the word " involving " can accommodate a generic - offense approach .
Cf . Scheidler v. National Organization for Women , Inc. , 537 U.S. 393 , 409 , 123 S.Ct . 1057 , 154 L.Ed.2d 991 ( 2003 ) ( " act or threat involving ... extortion , " 18 U.S.C. § 1961 ( 1 ) , contemplates " ' generic ' extortion " ( some internal quotation marks omitted ) ) .
But we have no reason to think Congress intended that approach for § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) -which uses no deeply rooted offense name like " extortion " and contrasts with the offense - oriented language of a neighboring provision .
Endeavoring to explain why Congress might have chosen " involving " over " is " in § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) , Shular suggests that variation in state drug - offense terminology required a word more approximate than " is . "
But if Congress was concerned that state drug offenses lacked clear , universally employed names , the evident solution was to identify them instead by conduct .
Using " involving " rather than " is " does not clarify that the terms are names of offenses ; quite the opposite .
See supra , at 785 .
Shular asserts that to describe conduct rather than offenses , Congress would have used the language of the elements clause of the " violent felony " definition , which captures a crime that " has as an element the use , attempted use , or threatened use of physical force against the person of another . "
§ 924(e)(2)(B)(i ) ( emphasis added ) .
It would have been awkward , however , to describe " possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute"-requiring both possession and intent - as " an element . "
Congress may also have wanted to clarify that the state offense need not include the identified conduct as a formal element .
Cf . Kawashima , 565 U.S. at 483 - 484 , 132 S.Ct . 1166 ( the statutory phrase " an offense that ... involves fraud or deceit " " is not limited to offenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements " but extends to offenses " that necessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful conduct " ) .
Whatever the reason , Congress ' choice not to describe each term in § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) as " an element " neither refutes that those terms refer to conduct nor shows that they refer to offenses .
Nor does the other clause of the " serious drug offense " definition shed light on the question before us .
Section 924(e)(2)(A)(i ) includes as " serious drug offenses " " offense[s ] under " specific portions of the U.S. Code .
That provision , Shular observes , refers to fully defined crimes .
But " the divergent text of the two provisions " of the serious - drug - offense definition , as the Government explains , " makes any divergence in their application unremarkable . "
Brief for United States 22 . Congress ' decision to identify federal offenses by reference to the U.S. Code does not speak to whether it identified state offenses by reference to named offenses or conduct .
D
Shular expresses concern that rejecting a generic - offense approach would yield an anomalous result .
Unlike other drug laws , Shular contends , the Florida law under which he was previously convicted does not require that the defendant know the substance is illicit .
Unless § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) takes into account all the elements of the offense as commonly understood , Shular maintains , defendants would face ACCA enhancement based on outlier state laws .
As an initial matter , Shular overstates Florida 's disregard for mens rea .
Charged under Fla. Stat . § 893.13 ( 1)(a ) , a defendant unaware of the substance 's illicit nature can raise that unawareness as an affirmative defense , in which case the standard jury instructions require a finding of knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt .
§ 893.101(2 ) ; Fla. Crim . Jury Instr . § 25.2 ( 2020 ) , https://www.floridasupremecourt.org/content/download/568865/6425767/file/EntireDocument.rtf .
In any event , both parties ' interpretations of 18 U.S.C. § 924 ( e)(2)(A)(ii ) achieve a measure of consistency .
Resolving this case requires us to determine which form of consistency Congress intended : application of ACCA to all offenders who engaged in certain conduct or to all who committed certain generic offenses ( in either reading , judging only by the elements of their prior convictions ) .
For the reasons explained , we are persuaded that Congress chose the former .
E
Shular urges us to apply the rule of lenity in determining whether § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) requires a generic - offense - matching analysis .
The rule " applies only when , after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction , we are left with an ambiguous statute . "
United States v. Shabani , 513 U.S. 10 , 17 , 115 S.Ct . 382 , 130 L.Ed.2d 225 ( 1994 ) .
Here , we are left with no ambiguity for the rule of lenity to resolve .
Section 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) 's text and context leave no doubt that it refers to an offense involving the conduct of " manufacturing , distributing , or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute , a controlled substance . "
Because those terms describe conduct and do not name offenses , a court applying § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii ) need not delineate the elements of generic offenses .

For the reasons stated , the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is Affirmed .
