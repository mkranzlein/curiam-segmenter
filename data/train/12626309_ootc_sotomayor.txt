Justice SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court .
In Kokesh v. SEC , 581 U. S. ---- , 137 S.Ct . 1635 , 198 L.Ed.2d 86 ( 2017 ) , this Court held that a disgorgement order in a Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) enforcement action imposes a " penalty " for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 2462 , the applicable statute of limitations .
In so deciding , the Court reserved an antecedent question : whether , and to what extent , the SEC may seek " disgorgement " in the first instance through its power to award " equitable relief " under 15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(5 ) , a power that historically excludes punitive sanctions .
The Court holds today that a disgorgement award that does not exceed a wrongdoer 's net profits and is awarded for victims is equitable relief permissible under § 78u(d)(5 ) .
The judgment is vacated , and the case is remanded for the courts below to ensure the award was so limited .
I
A
Congress authorized the SEC to enforce the Securities Act of 1933 , 48 Stat . 74 , as amended , 15 U.S.C. § 77a et seq . , and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , 48 Stat . 881 , as amended , 15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq . , and to punish securities fraud through administrative and civil proceedings .
In administrative proceedings , the SEC can seek limited civil penalties and " disgorgement . "
See § 77h-1(e ) ( " In any cease - and - desist proceeding under subsection ( a ) , the Commission may enter an order requiring accounting and disgorgement " ) ; see also § 77h-1(g ) ( " Authority to impose money penalties " ) .
In civil actions , the SEC can seek civil penalties and " equitable relief . "
See , e.g. , § 78u(d)(5 ) ( " In any action or proceeding brought or instituted by the Commission under any provision of the securities laws , ... any Federal court may grant ... any equitable relief that may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors " ) ; see also § 78u(d)(3 ) ( " Money penalties in civil actions " ( quotation modified ) ) .
Congress did not define what falls under the umbrella of " equitable relief . "
Thus , courts have had to consider which remedies the SEC may impose as part of its § 78u(d)(5 ) powers .
Starting with SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co. , 446 F.2d 1301 ( CA2 1971 ) , courts determined that the SEC had authority to obtain what it called " restitution , " and what in substance amounted to " profits " that " merely depriv[e ] " a defendant of " the gains of ... wrongful conduct . "
Id. , at 1307 - 1308 .
Over the years , the SEC has continued to request this remedy , later referred to as " disgorgement , " and courts have continued to award it .
See SEC v. Commonwealth Chemical Securities , Inc. , 574 F.2d 90 , 95 ( CA2 1978 ) ( explaining that , when a court awards " [ d]isgorgement of profits in an action brought by the SEC , " it is " exercising the chancellor 's discretion to prevent unjust enrichment " ) ; see also SEC v. Blatt , 583 F.2d 1325 , 1335 ( CA5 1978 ) ; SEC v. Washington Cty . Util . Dist . , 676 F.2d 218 , 227 ( CA6 1982 ) .
In Kokesh , this Court determined that disgorgement constituted a " penalty " for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 2462 , which establishes a 5 - year statute of limitations for " an action , suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine , penalty , or forfeiture . "
The Court reached this conclusion based on several considerations , namely , that disgorgement is imposed as a consequence of violating public laws , it is assessed in part for punitive purposes , and in many cases , the award is not compensatory .
581 U. S. , at ---- - ---- , 137 S.Ct . , at 1643 - 1644 .
But the Court did not address whether a § 2462 penalty can nevertheless qualify as " equitable relief " under § 78u(d)(5 ) , given that equity never " lends its aid to enforce a forfeiture or penalty . "
Marshall v. Vicksburg , 15 Wall . 146 , 149 , 21 L.Ed . 121 ( 1873 ) .
The Court cautioned , moreover , that its decision should not be interpreted " as an opinion on whether courts possess authority to order disgorgement in SEC enforcement proceedings . "
Kokesh , 581 U. S. , at ---- , n. 3 , 137 S.Ct . , at 1642 n. 3 .
This question is now squarely before the Court .
B
The SEC action and disgorgement award at issue here arise from a scheme to defraud foreign nationals .
Petitioners Charles Liu and his wife , Xin ( Lisa ) Wang , solicited nearly $ 27 million from foreign investors under the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program ( EB-5 Program ) .
754 Fed . Appx . 505 , 506 ( CA9 2018 ) ( case below ) .
The EB-5 Program , administered by the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services , permits noncitizens to apply for permanent residence in the United States by investing in approved commercial enterprises that are based on " proposals for promoting economic growth . "
See USCIS , EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program , https://www.uscis.gov/eb-5 .
Investments in EB-5 projects are subject to the federal securities laws .
Liu sent a private offering memorandum to prospective investors , pledging that the bulk of any contributions would go toward the construction costs of a cancer - treatment center .
The memorandum specified that only amounts collected from a small administrative fee would fund " ' legal , accounting and administration expenses . ' "
754 Fed . Appx . at 507 .
An SEC investigation revealed , however , that Liu spent nearly $ 20 million of investor money on ostensible marketing expenses and salaries , an amount far more than what the offering memorandum permitted and far in excess of the administrative fees collected .
262 F.Supp.3d 957 , 960 - 964 ( CD Cal . 2017 ) .
The investigation also revealed that Liu diverted a sizable portion of those funds to personal accounts and to a company under Wang 's control .
Id. , at 961 , 964 .
Only a fraction of the funds were put toward a lease , property improvements , and a proton - therapy machine for cancer treatment .
Id. , at 964 - 965 .
The SEC brought a civil action against petitioners , alleging that they violated the terms of the offering documents by misappropriating millions of dollars .
The District Court found for the SEC , granting an injunction barring petitioners from participating in the EB-5 Program and imposing a civil penalty at the highest tier authorized .
Id. , at 975 , 976 .
It also ordered disgorgement equal to the full amount petitioners had raised from investors , less the $ 234,899 that remained in the corporate accounts for the project .
Id. , at 975 - 976 .
Petitioners objected that the disgorgement award failed to account for their business expenses .
The District Court disagreed , concluding that the sum was a " reasonable approximation of the profits causally connected to [ their ] violation . "
Ibid .
The court ordered petitioners jointly and severally liable for the full amount that the SEC sought .
App . to Pet . for Cert . 62a .
The Ninth Circuit affirmed .
It acknowledged that Kokesh " expressly refused to reach " the issue whether the District Court had the authority to order disgorgement .
754 Fed . Appx . at 509 .
The court relied on Circuit precedent to conclude that the " proper amount of disgorgement in a scheme such as this one is the entire amount raised less the money paid back to the investors . "
Ibid . ; see also SEC v. JT Wallenbrock & Assocs . , 440 F.3d 1109 , 1113 , 1114 ( CA9 2006 ) ( reasoning that it would be " unjust to permit the defendants to offset ... the expenses of running the very business they created to defraud ... investors " ) .
We granted certiorari to determine whether § 78u(d)(5 ) authorizes the SEC to seek disgorgement beyond a defendant 's net profits from wrongdoing .
589 U. S. ---- , 140 S.Ct . 451 , 205 L.Ed.2d 265 ( 2019 ) .
II
Our task is a familiar one .
In interpreting statutes like § 78u(d)(5 ) that provide for " equitable relief , " this Court analyzes whether a particular remedy falls into " those categories of relief that were typically available in equity . "
Mertens v. Hewitt Associates , 508 U.S. 248 , 256 , 113 S.Ct . 2063 , 124 L.Ed.2d 161 ( 1993 ) ; see also CIGNA Corp. v. Amara , 563 U.S. 421 , 439 , 131 S.Ct . 1866 , 179 L.Ed.2d 843 ( 2011 ) ; Montanile v. Board of Trustees of Nat .
Elevator Industry Health Benefit Plan , 577 U. S. 136 , 142 , 136 S.Ct . 651 , 193 L.Ed.2d 556 ( 2016 ) .
The " basic contours of the term are well known " and can be discerned by consulting works on equity jurisprudence .
Great - West Life & Annuity Ins . Co. v. Knudson , 534 U.S. 204 , 217 , 122 S.Ct . 708 , 151 L.Ed.2d 635 ( 2002 ) .
These works on equity jurisprudence reveal two principles .
First , equity practice long authorized courts to strip wrongdoers of their ill - gotten gains , with scholars and courts using various labels for the remedy .
Second , to avoid transforming an equitable remedy into a punitive sanction , courts restricted the remedy to an individual wrongdoer 's net profits to be awarded for victims .
A
Equity courts have routinely deprived wrongdoers of their net profits from unlawful activity , even though that remedy may have gone by different names .
Compare , e.g. , 1 D. Dobbs , Law of Remedies § 4.3(5 ) , p. 611 ( 1993 ) ( " Accounting holds the defendant liable for his profits " ) , with i d. , § 4.1(1 ) , at 555 ( referring to " restitution " as the relief that " measures the remedy by the defendant 's gain and seeks to force disgorgement of that gain " ) ; see also Restatement ( Third ) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment § 51 , Comment a , p. 204 ( 2010 ) ( Restatement ( Third ) ) ( " Restitution measured by the defendant 's wrongful gain is frequently called ' disgorgement . '
Other cases refer to an ' accounting ' or an ' accounting for profits ' " ) ; 1 J. Pomeroy , Equity Jurisprudence § 101 , p. 112 ( 4th ed . 1918 ) ( describing an accounting as an equitable remedy for the violation of strictly legal primary rights ) .
No matter the label , this " profit - based measure of unjust enrichment , " Restatement ( Third ) § 51 , Comment a , at 204 , reflected a foundational principle : " [ I]t would be inequitable that [ a wrongdoer ] should make a profit out of his own wrong , " Root v. Railway Co. , 105 U.S. 189 , 207 , 26 L.Ed . 975 ( 1882 ) .
At the same time courts recognized that the wrongdoer should not profit " by his own wrong , " they also recognized the countervailing equitable principle that the wrongdoer should not be punished by " pay[ing ] more than a fair compensation to the person wronged . "
Tilghman v. Proctor , 125 U.S. 136 , 145 - 146 , 8 S.Ct . 894 , 31 L.Ed . 664 ( 1888 ) .
Decisions from this Court confirm that a remedy tethered to a wrongdoer 's net unlawful profits , whatever the name , has been a mainstay of equity courts .
In Porter v. Warner Holding Co. , 328 U.S. 395 , 66 S.Ct . 1086 , 90 L.Ed . 1332 ( 1946 ) , the Court interpreted a section of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 that encompassed a " comprehensiv[e ] " grant of " equitable jurisdiction . "
Id. , at 398 , 66 S.Ct . 1086 .
" [ O]nce [ a District Court 's ] equity jurisdiction has been invoked " under that provision , the Court concluded , " a decree compelling one to disgorge profits ... may properly be entered . "
Id. , at 398 - 399 , 66 S.Ct . 1086 .
Subsequent cases confirm the " ' protean character ' of the profits - recovery remedy . "
Petrella v. Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer , Inc. , 572 U.S. 663 , 668 , n. 1 , 134 S.Ct . 1962 , 188 L.Ed.2d 979 ( 2014 ) .
In Tull v. United States , 481 U.S. 412 , 107 S.Ct . 1831 , 95 L.Ed.2d 365 ( 1987 ) , the Court described " disgorgement of improper profits " as " traditionally considered an equitable remedy . "
Id. , at 424 , 107 S.Ct . 1831 .
While the Court acknowledged that disgorgement was a " limited form of penalty " insofar as it takes money out of the wrongdoer 's hands , it nevertheless compared disgorgement to restitution that simply " ' restor[es ] the status quo , ' "
thus situating the remedy squarely within the heartland of equity .
Ibid .
In Great - West , the Court noted that an " accounting for profits " was historically a " form of equitable restitution . "
534 U.S. at 214 , n. 2 , 122 S.Ct . 708 .
And in Kansas v. Nebraska , 574 U.S. 445 , 135 S.Ct . 1042 , 191 L.Ed.2d 1 ( 2015 ) , a " ' basically equitable ' " original jurisdiction proceeding , the Court ordered disgorgement of Nebraska 's gains from exceeding its allocation under an interstate water compact .
Id. , at 453 , 475 , 135 S.Ct . 1042 .
Most recently , in SCA Hygiene Products Aktiebolag v. First Quality Baby Products , LLC , 580 U. S. ---- , 137 S.Ct . 954 , 197 L.Ed.2d 292 ( 2017 ) , the Court canvassed pre-1938 patent cases invoking equity jurisdiction .
It noted that many cases sought an " accounting , " which it described as an equitable remedy requiring disgorgement of ill - gotten profits .
Id. , at ---- , 137 S.Ct , at . 964 .
This Court 's " transsubstantive guidance on broad and fundamental " equitable principles , Romag Fasteners , Inc. v. Fossil Group , Inc. , 590 U. S. ---- , ---- , 140 S.Ct . 1492 , 1496 , 206 L.Ed.2d 672 ( 2020 ) , thus reflects the teachings of equity treatises that identify a defendant 's net profits as a remedy for wrongdoing .
Contrary to petitioners ' argument , equity courts did not limit this remedy to cases involving a breach of trust or of fiduciary duty .
Brief for Petitioners 28 - 29 .
As petitioners acknowledge , courts authorized profits - based relief in patent - infringement actions where no such trust or special relationship existed .
Id. , at 29 ; see also Root , 105 U.S. at 214 ( " [ I]t is nowhere said that the patentee 's right to an account is based upon the idea that there is a fiduciary relation created between him and the wrong - doer by the fact of infringement " ) .
Petitioners attempt to distinguish these patent cases by suggesting that an " accounting " was appropriate only because Congress explicitly conferred that remedy by statute in 1870 .
Brief for Petitioners 29 ( citing the Act of July 8 , 1870 , § 55 , 16 Stat . 206 ) .
But patent law had not previously deviated from the general principles outlined above : This Court had developed the rule that a plaintiff may " recover the amount of ... profits that the defendants have made by the use of his invention " through " a series of decisions under the patent act of 1836 , which simply conferred upon the courts of the United States general equity jurisdiction ... in cases arising under the patent laws . "
Tilghman , 125 U.S. at 144 , 8 S.Ct . 894 .
The 1836 statute , in turn , incorporated the substance of an earlier statute from 1819 which granted courts the ability to " proceed according to the course and principles of courts of equity " to " prevent the violation of patent - rights . "
Root , 105 U.S. at 193 .
Thus , as these cases demonstrate , equity courts habitually awarded profits - based remedies in patent cases well before Congress explicitly authorized that form of relief .
B
While equity courts did not limit profits remedies to particular types of cases , they did circumscribe the award in multiple ways to avoid transforming it into a penalty outside their equitable powers .
See Marshall , 15 Wall . at 149 .
For one , the profits remedy often imposed a constructive trust on wrongful gains for wronged victims .
The remedy itself thus converted the wrongdoer , who in many cases was an infringer , " into a trustee , as to those profits , for the owner of the patent which he infringes . "
Burdell v. Denig , 92 U.S. 716 , 720 , 23 L.Ed . 764 ( 1876 ) .
In " converting the infringer into a trustee for the patentee as regards the profits thus made , " the chancellor " estimat[es ] the compensation due from the infringer to the patentee . "
Packet Co. v. Sickles , 19 Wall . 611 , 617 - 618 , 22 L.Ed . 203 ( 1874 ) ; see also Clews v. Jamieson , 182 U.S. 461 , 480 , 21 S.Ct . 845 , 45 L.Ed . 1183 ( 1901 ) ( describing an accounting as involving a " ' distribution of the trust moneys among all the beneficiaries who are entitled to share therein ' " in an action against the governing committee of a stock exchange ) .
Equity courts also generally awarded profits - based remedies against individuals or partners engaged in concerted wrongdoing , not against multiple wrongdoers under a joint - and - several liability theory .
See Ambler v. Whipple , 20 Wall .
546 , 559 , 22 L.Ed . 403 ( 1874 ) ( ordering an accounting against a partner who had " knowingly connected himself with and aided in ... fraud " ) .
In Elizabeth v. Pavement Co. , 97 U.S. 126 , 24 L.Ed . 1000 ( 1878 ) , for example , a city engaged contractors to install pavement in a manner that infringed a third party 's patent .
The patent holder brought a suit in equity to recover profits from both the city and its contractors .
The Court held that only the contractors ( the only parties to make a profit ) were responsible , even though the parties answered jointly .
Id. , at 140 ; see also ibid .
( rejecting liability for an individual officer who merely acted as an agent of the defendant and received a salary for his work ) .
The rule against joint - and - several liability for profits that have accrued to another appears throughout equity cases awarding profits .
See , e.g. , Belknap v. Schild , 161 U.S. 10 , 25 - 26 , 16 S.Ct . 443 , 40 L.Ed . 599 ( 1896 ) ( " The defendants , in any such suit , are therefore liable to account for such profits only as have accrued to themselves from the use of the invention , and not for those which have accrued to another , and in which they have no participation " ) ; Keystone Mfg . Co. v. Adams , 151 U.S. 139 , 148 , 14 S.Ct . 295 , 38 L.Ed . 103 ( 1894 ) ( reversing profits award that was based not on what defendant had made from infringement but on what third persons had made from the use of the invention ) ; Jennings v. Carson , 4 Cranch 2 , 21 , 2 L.Ed .
531 ( 1807 ) ( holding that an order requiring restitution could not apply to " those who were not in possession of the thing to be restored " and " had no power over it " ) ( citing Penhallow v. Doane 's Administrators , 3 Dall .
54 , 1 L.Ed . 507 ( 1795 ) ( reversing a restitution award in admiralty that ordered joint damages in excess of what each defendant received ) ) .
Finally , courts limited awards to the net profits from wrongdoing , that is , " the gain made upon any business or investment , when both the receipts and payments are taken into the account . "
Rubber Co. v. Goodyear , 9 Wall . 788 , 804 , 19 L.Ed . 566 ( 1870 ) ; see also Livingston v. Woodworth , 15 How . 546 , 559 - 560 , 14 L.Ed . 809 ( 1854 ) ( restricting an accounting remedy " to the actual gains and profits ... during the time " the infringing machine " was in operation and during no other period " to avoid " convert[ing ] a court of equity into an instrument for the punishment of simple torts " ) ; Seymour v. McCormick , 16 How . 480 , 490 , 14 L.Ed . 1024 ( 1854 ) ( rejecting a blanket rule that infringing one component of a machine warranted a remedy measured by the full amounts of the profits earned from the machine ) ; Mowry v. Whitney , 14 Wall . 620 , 649 , 20 L.Ed . 860 ( 1872 ) ( vacating an accounting that exceeded the profits from infringement alone ) ; Wooden - Ware Co. v. United States , 106 U.S. 432 , 434 - 435 , 1 S.Ct . 398 , 27 L.Ed . 230 ( 1882 ) ( explaining that an innocent trespasser is entitled to deduct labor costs from the gains obtained by wrongfully harvesting lumber ) .
The Court has carved out an exception when the " entire profit of a business or undertaking " results from the wrongful activity .
Root , 105 U.S. at 203 .
In such cases , the Court has explained , the defendant " will not be allowed to diminish the show of profits by putting in unconscionable claims for personal services or other inequitable deductions . "
Ibid .
In Goodyear , for example , the Court affirmed an accounting order that refused to deduct expenses under this rule .
The Court there found that materials for which expenses were claimed were bought for the purposes of the infringement and " extraordinary salaries " appeared merely to be " dividends of profit under another name . "
9 Wall . at 803 ; see also Callaghan v. Myers , 128 U.S. 617 , 663 - 664 , 9 S.Ct . 177 , 32 L.Ed . 547 ( 1888 ) ( declining to deduct a defendant 's personal and living expenses from his profits from copyright violations , but distinguishing the expenses from salaries of officers in a corporation ) .
Setting aside that circumstance , however , courts consistently restricted awards to net profits from wrongdoing after deducting legitimate expenses .
Such remedies , when assessed against only culpable actors and for victims , fall comfortably within " those categories of relief that were typically available in equity . "
Mertens , 508 U.S. at 256 , 113 S.Ct . 2063 .
C
By incorporating these longstanding equitable principles into § 78u(d)(5 ) , Congress prohibited the SEC from seeking an equitable remedy in excess of a defendant 's net profits from wrongdoing .
To be sure , the SEC originally endeavored to conform its disgorgement remedy to the common - law limitations in § 78u(d)(5 ) .
Over the years , however , courts have occasionally awarded disgorgement in three main ways that test the bounds of equity practice : by ordering the proceeds of fraud to be deposited in Treasury funds instead of disbursing them to victims , imposing joint - and - several disgorgement liability , and declining to deduct even legitimate expenses from the receipts of fraud .
The SEC 's disgorgement remedy in such incarnations is in considerable tension with equity practices .
Petitioners go further .
They claim that this Court effectively decided in Kokesh that disgorgement is necessarily a penalty , and thus not the kind of relief available at equity .
Brief for Petitioners 19 - 20 , 22 - 26 .
Not so .
Kokesh expressly declined to pass on the question .
581 U. S. , at ---- , n. 3 , 137 S.Ct . at 1642 n.3 .
To be sure , the Kokesh Court evaluated a version of the SEC 's disgorgement remedy that seemed to exceed the bounds of traditional equitable principles .
But that decision has no bearing on the SEC 's ability to conform future requests for a defendant 's profits to the limits outlined in common - law cases awarding a wrongdoer 's net gains .
The Government , for its part , contends that the SEC 's interpretation of the equitable disgorgement remedy has Congress ' tacit support , even if it exceeds the bounds of equity practice .
Brief for Respondent 13 - 21 .
It points to the fact that Congress has enacted a number of other statutes referring to " disgorgement . "
That argument attaches undue significance to Congress ' use of the term .
It is true that Congress has authorized the SEC to seek " disgorgement " in administrative actions .
15 U.S.C. § 77h-1(e ) ( " In any cease - and - desist proceeding under subsection ( a ) , the Commission may enter an order requiring accounting and disgorgement " ) .
But it makes sense that Congress would expressly name the equitable powers it grants to an agency for use in administrative proceedings .
After all , agencies are unlike federal courts where , " [ u]nless otherwise provided by statute , all ... inherent equitable powers ... are available for the proper and complete exercise of that jurisdiction . "
Porter , 328 U.S. at 398 , 66 S.Ct . 1086 .
Congress does not enlarge the breadth of an equitable , profit - based remedy simply by using the term " disgorgement " in various statutes .
The Government argues that under the prior - construction principle , Congress should be presumed to have been aware of the scope of " disgorgement " as interpreted by lower courts and as having incorporated the ( purportedly ) prevailing meaning of the term into its subsequent enactments .
Brief for Respondent 24 .
But " that canon has no application " where , among other things , the scope of disgorgement was " far from ' settled . ' "
Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center , Inc. , 575 U.S. 320 , 330 , 135 S.Ct . 1378 , 191 L.Ed.2d 471 ( 2015 ) .
At bottom , even if Congress employed " disgorgement " as a shorthand to cross - reference the relief permitted by § 78u(d)(5 ) , it did not silently rewrite the scope of what the SEC could recover in a way that would contravene limitations embedded in the statute .
After all , such " statutory reference[s ] " to a remedy grounded in equity " must , absent other indication , be deemed to contain the limitations upon its availability that equity typically imposes . "
Great - West , 534 U.S. at 211 , n. 1 , 122 S.Ct . 708 .
Accordingly , Congress ' own use of the term " disgorgement " in assorted statutes did not expand the contours of that term beyond a defendant 's net profits - a limit established by longstanding principles of equity .
III
Applying the principles discussed above to the facts of this case , petitioners briefly argue that their disgorgement award is unlawful because it crosses the bounds of traditional equity practice in three ways : It fails to return funds to victims , it imposes joint - and - several liability , and it declines to deduct business expenses from the award .
Because the parties focused on the broad question whether any form of disgorgement may be ordered and did not fully brief these narrower questions , we do not decide them here .
We nevertheless discuss principles that may guide the lower courts ' assessment of these arguments on remand .
A
Section 78u(d)(5 ) restricts equitable relief to that which " may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors . "
The SEC , however , does not always return the entirety of disgorgement proceeds to investors , instead depositing a portion of its collections in a fund in the Treasury .
See SEC , Division of Enforcement , 2019 Ann . Rep. 16 - 17 , https://www.sec.gov/files/enforcement-annual-report-2019.pdf .
Congress established that fund in the Dodd - Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act for disgorgement awards that are not deposited in " disgorgement fund[s ] " or otherwise " distributed to victims . "
124 Stat . 1844 .
The statute provides that these sums may be used to pay whistleblowers reporting securities fraud and to fund the activities of the Inspector General .
Ibid .
Here , the SEC has not returned the bulk of funds to victims , largely , it contends , because the Government has been unable to collect them .
The statute provides limited guidance as to whether the practice of depositing a defendant 's gains with the Treasury satisfies the statute 's command that any remedy be " appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors . "
The equitable nature of the profits remedy generally requires the SEC to return a defendant 's gains to wronged investors for their benefit .
After all , the Government has pointed to no analogous common - law remedy permitting a wrongdoer 's profits to be withheld from a victim indefinitely without being disbursed to known victims .
Cf . Root , 105 U.S. at 214 - 215 ( comparing the accounting remedy to a breach - of - trust action , where a court would require the defendant to " refund the amount of profit which they have actually realized " ) .
The Government maintains , however , that the primary function of depriving wrongdoers of profits is to deny them the fruits of their ill - gotten gains , not to return the funds to victims as a kind of restitution .
See , e.g. , SEC , Report Pursuant to Section 308(C ) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 , p. 3 , n. 2 ( 2003 ) ( taking the position that disgorgement is not intended to make investors whole , but rather to deprive wrongdoers of ill - gotten gains ) ; see also 6 T. Hazen , Law of Securities Regulation § 16.18 , p. 8 ( rev . 7th ed . 2016 ) ( concluding that the remedial nature of the disgorgement remedy does not mean that it is essentially compensatory and concluding that the " primary function of the remedy is to deny the wrongdoer the fruits of ill - gotten gains " ) .
Under the Government 's theory , the very fact that it conducted an enforcement action satisfies the requirement that it is " appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors . "
But the SEC 's equitable , profits - based remedy must do more than simply benefit the public at large by virtue of depriving a wrongdoer of ill - gotten gains .
To hold otherwise would render meaningless the latter part of § 78u(d)(5 ) .
Indeed , this Court concluded similarly in Mertens when analyzing statutory language accompanying the term " equitable remedy . "
508 U.S. at 253 , 113 S.Ct . 2063 ( interpreting the term " appropriate equitable relief " ) .
There , the Court found that the additional statutory language must be given effect since the section " does not , after all , authorize ... ' equitable relief ' at large . "

As in Mertens , the phrase " appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors " must mean something more than depriving a wrongdoer of his net profits alone , else the Court would violate the " cardinal principle of interpretation that courts must give effect , if possible , to every clause and word of a statute . "
Parker Drilling Management Services , Ltd. v. Newton , 587 U. S. ---- , ---- , 139 S.Ct . 1881 , 1890 , 204 L.Ed.2d 165 ( 2019 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
The Government additionally suggests that the SEC 's practice of depositing disgorgement funds with the Treasury may be justified where it is infeasible to distribute the collected funds to investors .
Brief for Respondent 37 .
It is an open question whether , and to what extent , that practice nevertheless satisfies the SEC 's obligation to award relief " for the benefit of investors " and is consistent with the limitations of § 78u(d)(5 ) .
The parties have not identified authorities revealing what traditional equitable principles govern when , for instance , the wrongdoer 's profits can not practically be disbursed to the victims .
But we need not address the issue here .
The parties do not identify a specific order in this case directing any proceeds to the Treasury .
If one is entered on remand , the lower courts may evaluate in the first instance whether that order would indeed be for the benefit of investors as required by § 78u(d)(5 ) and consistent with equitable principles .

The SEC additionally has sought to impose disgorgement liability on a wrongdoer for benefits that accrue to his affiliates , sometimes through joint - and - several liability , in a manner sometimes seemingly at odds with the common - law rule requiring individual liability for wrongful profits .
See , e.g. , SEC v. Contorinis , 743 F.3d 296 , 302 ( CA2 2014 ) ( holding that a defendant could be forced to disgorge not only what he " personally enjoyed from his exploitation of inside information , but also the profits of such exploitation that he channeled to friends , family , or clients " ) ; SEC v. Clark , 915 F.2d 439 , 454 ( CA9 1990 ) ( " It is well settled that a tipper can be required to disgorge his tippee 's profits " ) ; SEC v. Whittemore , 659 F.3d 1 , 10 ( CADC 2011 ) ( approving joint - and - several disgorgement liability where there is a close relationship between the defendants and collaboration in executing the wrongdoing ) .
That practice could transform any equitable profits - focused remedy into a penalty .
Cf . Marshall , 15 Wall . at 149 .
And it runs against the rule to not impose joint liability in favor of holding defendants " liable to account for such profits only as have accrued to themselves ... and not for those which have accrued to another , and in which they have no participation . "
Belknap , 161 U.S. at 25 - 26 , 16 S.Ct . 443 ; see also Elizabeth v. Pavement Co. , 97 U.S. 126 , 24 L.Ed . 1000 ( 1878 ) .
The common law did , however , permit liability for partners engaged in concerted wrongdoing .
See , e.g. , Ambler , 20 Wall . at 559 .
The historic profits remedy thus allows some flexibility to impose collective liability .
Given the wide spectrum of relationships between participants and beneficiaries of unlawful schemes - from equally culpable codefendants to more remote , unrelated tipper - tippee arrangements - the Court need not wade into all the circumstances where an equitable profits remedy might be punitive when applied to multiple individuals .
Here , petitioners were married .
754 Fed . Appx . 505 ; 262 F.Supp.3d at 960 - 961 .
The Government introduced evidence that Liu formed business entities and solicited investments , which he misappropriated .
Id. , at 961 .
It also presented evidence that Wang held herself out as the president , and a member of the management team , of an entity to which Liu directed misappropriated funds .
Id. , at 964 .
Petitioners did not introduce evidence to suggest that one spouse was a mere passive recipient of profits .
Nor did they suggest that their finances were not commingled , or that one spouse did not enjoy the fruits of the scheme , or that other circumstances would render a joint - and - several disgorgement order unjust .
Cf . SEC v. Hughes Capital Corp. , 124 F.3d 449 , 456 ( CA3 1997 ) ( finding that codefendant spouse was liable for unlawful proceeds where they funded her " lavish lifestyle " ) .
We leave it to the Ninth Circuit on remand to determine whether the facts are such that petitioners can , consistent with equitable principles , be found liable for profits as partners in wrongdoing or whether individual liability is required .

Courts may not enter disgorgement awards that exceed the gains " made upon any business or investment , when both the receipts and payments are taken into the account . "
Goodyear , 9 Wall . at 804 ; see also Restatement ( Third ) § 51 , Comment h , at 216 ( reciting the general rule that a defendant is entitled to a deduction for all marginal costs incurred in producing the revenues that are subject to disgorgement ) .
Accordingly , courts must deduct legitimate expenses before ordering disgorgement under § 78u(d)(5 ) .
A rule to the contrary that " make[s ] no allowance for the cost and expense of conducting [ a ] business " would be " inconsistent with the ordinary principles and practice of courts of chancery . "
Tilghman , 125 U.S. at 145 - 146 , 8 S.Ct . 894 ; cf . SEC v. Brown , 658 F.3d 858 , 861 ( CA8 2011 ) ( declining to deduct even legitimate expenses like payments to innocent third - party employees and vendors ) .
The District Court below declined to deduct expenses on the theory that they were incurred for the purposes of furthering an entirely fraudulent scheme .
It is true that when the " entire profit of a business or undertaking " results from the wrongdoing , a defendant may be denied " inequitable deductions " such as for personal services .
Root , 105 U.S. at 203 .
But that exception requires ascertaining whether expenses are legitimate or whether they are merely wrongful gains " under another name . "
Goodyear , 9 Wall . at 803 .
Doing so will ensure that any disgorgement award falls within the limits of equity practice while preventing defendants from profiting from their own wrong .
Root , 105 U.S. at 207 .
Although it is not necessary to set forth more guidance addressing the various circumstances where a defendant 's expenses might be considered wholly fraudulent , it suffices to note that some expenses from petitioners ' scheme went toward lease payments and cancer - treatment equipment .
Such items arguably have value independent of fueling a fraudulent scheme .
We leave it to the lower court to examine whether including those expenses in a profits - based remedy is consistent with the equitable principles underlying § 78u(d)(5 ) .

For the foregoing reasons , we vacate the judgment below and remand the case to the Ninth Circuit for further proceedings consistent with this opinion .
It is so ordered .
